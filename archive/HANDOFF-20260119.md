# HANDOFF: LeverEdge AI Agency Build Session

**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Handoff From:** Claude (Launch Coach in Claude.ai)
**Handoff To:** Next Claude session
**Status:** Mid-sprint, GSD ready to fire

---

## WHO IS DAMON

- Building **LeverEdge**, an AI automation agency targeting compliance professionals
- **Launch date:** March 1, 2026 (41 days away)
- **Revenue goal:** $30K MRR to leave government job (water rights enforcement)
- **Background:** Civil engineering + law degree
- **Has ADHD:** Prefers learning by building production systems, needs structure
- **Budget:** Claude Max ($200/mo), self-hosted infrastructure on Contabo VPS (~$15/mo)

---

## THE SYSTEM

### What LeverEdge Is
A multi-agent AI system with Greek mythology + Game of Thrones themed agents. Each agent has a specific function. The system runs on a hardened Contabo VPS with Docker containers, Supabase, Caddy reverse proxy, behind Cloudflare.

### Key Infrastructure
| Component | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| All code | `/opt/leveredge/` |
| Agent services | `/opt/leveredge/control-plane/agents/` |
| n8n workflows | 3 instances (PROD 5678, DEV 5680, CONTROL 5679) |
| Database | Supabase (PROD 54322, DEV 54323) |
| Specs/GSDs | `/opt/leveredge/specs/` |
| Docs | `/opt/leveredge/docs-site/docs/` |
| Config | `/opt/leveredge/config/` |

### How You Interact
You are the **Launch Coach** operating in Claude.ai with HEPHAESTUS MCP access. You do NOT have direct bash/docker access. You:
1. Create specs and GSDs (Get Stuff Done documents)
2. Use HEPHAESTUS MCP tools: `list_directory`, `read_file`, `create_file`, `run_command`, `list_workflows`, `call_agent`, `git_commit`
3. Give Damon copy-paste commands for **Claude Code** (VS Code) to execute complex builds

### The GSD Pattern
```
1. Write detailed spec to /opt/leveredge/specs/gsd-{name}.md
2. Damon copies to Claude Code with context
3. Claude Code executes, commits
4. Damon reports back results
```

## CURRENT STATE

### What's Happening Right Now
We identified **naming chaos and redundancy** in the agent fleet:
- Multiple agents doing the same thing (e.g., WORKFLOW-BUILDER vs HEPHAESTUS)
- Inconsistent naming (some generic, some themed)
- ~8 redundant agents need to be killed

### GSD Ready to Fire
```
/gsd /opt/leveredge/specs/gsd-agent-cleanup.md

Context: Clean up redundant agents and establish alias system.
Kill 8 redundant containers (WORKFLOW-BUILDER, PLUTUS, IRIS, LIBRARIAN@8201, HERACLES, THEMIS, MENTOR, PROCUREMENT).
Create /opt/leveredge/config/agent-aliases.json with generic→alias mapping.
Create /opt/leveredge/shared/agent_aliases.py helper library.
Update Fleet Dashboard to load from registry.
Update AGENT-REGISTRY.md with accurate 27-agent list.
```

### The Cleanup Plan
**Kill List (8 agents):**
| Agent | Port | Reason |
|-------|------|--------|
| WORKFLOW-BUILDER | 8202 | HEPHAESTUS builds everything |
| PLUTUS | 8205 | LITTLEFINGER handles finance |
| IRIS | 8209 | HERMES handles communications |
| LIBRARIAN | 8201 | LCIS LIBRARIAN (8050) handles knowledge |
| HERACLES | 8200 | Consolidate into MAGNUS/VARYS |
| THEMIS | 8203 | Consolidate into ATHENA |
| MENTOR | 8204 | Consolidate into CHIRON |
| PROCUREMENT | 8206 | Consolidate into LITTLEFINGER |

**Naming Convention Being Established:**
- **Generic names** in code: `builder`, `finance`, `notifications`
- **Aliases** in UI: `HEPHAESTUS`, `LITTLEFINGER`, `HERMES`
- Registry file maps between them

## RULES TO FOLLOW

1. **Dev-first workflow:** All changes go to DEV environment first, test, then `promote-to-prod.sh`
2. **Never update n8n workflows via direct SQL** - breaks versioning, use n8n MCP tools
3. **Agent routing:** Always route through designated agent (HEPHAESTUS=files, CHRONOS=backup, HADES=rollback, AEGIS=credentials, HERMES=notify)
4. **GSD pattern:** Write spec → CHRONOS backup → provide "/gsd [path]" as copy-paste → verify → HADES rollback if needed
5. **ARIA knowledge:** After significant ops, call `aria_add_knowledge()` to keep ARIA informed
6. **Pre-compact rule:** Before context clears, capture learnings to LESSONS-SCRATCH.md
7. **January = infrastructure month:** Don't push Damon toward outreach until February

---

## WHAT TO DO NEXT

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Fire the agent cleanup GSD (command above)
2. Verify 8 containers killed, 27 agents remain
3. Test alias system works

### After Cleanup
Options for next builds:
- **DAEDALUS** (8026) - Infrastructure architect (spec exists, not deployed)
- **Alchemy agents** - MUSE, QUILL, STAGE, REEL, CRITIC (content creation, not built)
- **More pipelines** - Wire up existing agents into workflows

### February Focus (Starts Feb 1)
- Niche research
- TRW Outreach Module
- 10 outreach attempts, 3 discovery calls by end of month

---

## HOW TO VERIFY STATE

Ask Claude Code to run:
```bash
# Check running containers
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Status}}" | head -50

# Check agent health
for port in 8019 8020 8050 8052 8099 8114; do
  echo -n "Port $port: "
  curl -s http://localhost:$port/health | jq -r '.service // .status // "unknown"'
done

# Check recent commits
cd /opt/leveredge && git log --oneline -10
```

---

## DAMON'S COMMUNICATION STYLE

- Direct, wants results not explanations
- Will push back if something seems wrong (trust his instincts)
- Prefers copy-paste ready commands
- "Do it all" means execute the full plan
- Gets frustrated with redundancy and confusion
- Appreciates when you catch issues before they become problems

---

## SESSION CONTEXT

This was a marathon build session. Damon said "All of them" to the full January sprint and we executed:
- VARYS (10 min)
- LITTLEFINGER (6 min)
- Command Center (4 min)
- Pipeline System (5 min)
- MAGNUS Adapters + OpenProject (multiple commits)
- Agent Documentation (7 min)

Then discovered naming chaos. Created cleanup GSD. Ready to fire.

**The agent cleanup GSD is the immediate next action.**

*"41 days to launch. The pieces are in position. Checkmate is inevitable."*
