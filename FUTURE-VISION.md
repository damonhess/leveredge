## Key Principles

1. **Build to solve your own problems first** - Then sell to others
2. **Dev-first deployment** - Never push directly to prod
3. **ATLAS for ops, ARIA for personal** - Don't confuse them
4. **Cost awareness** - Track every API call
5. **Ship over perfect** - Good enough to demo > perfect but hidden
6. **Document as you go** - Future you will thank present you

---

## Red Flags to Watch

- "I should build one more feature..."
- "I need to perfect ARIA before..."
- New infrastructure that doesn't serve launch
- Avoiding outreach prep (fear of rejection)
- Expanding scope instead of shipping

---

## Damon's Strengths

- Technical skills (n8n, Supabase, MCP servers, AI agents)
- $57K-$109K portfolio of production systems
- Understands compliance/government workflows
- Can sell when he believes in product (Burning Man proof)
- Self-aware about ADHD patterns

---

## Future Product Ideas (Post-Launch)

### Geopolitical Intelligence System
- Multi-agent news analysis
- Bias detection
- Timeline: 6-12 months post-launch
- Separate product, not ARIA feature

### Multi-Tenant Platform
- White-label options
- Client portal
- API access
- SOC 2 preparation
