## Key Principles

1. **Build to solve your own problems first** - Then sell to others
2. **Dev-first deployment** - Never push directly to prod
3. **Design before build** - Specs before code
4. **Cost awareness** - Track every API call
5. **Ship over perfect** - Good enough to demo > perfect but hidden
6. **Document as you go** - Future you will thank present you
7. **Native n8n nodes over Code nodes** - Visibility matters
8. **ARIA is the interface, agents are the capability** - Users talk to ARIA
