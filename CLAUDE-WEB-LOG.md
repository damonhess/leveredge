## LAST SESSION SUMMARY

- Reviewed full agent fleet status (80 containers, 29 agents)
- Found ARIA is stateless (web/mobile don't sync) - specs exist but not built
- ARIA Prod was down, Claude Code fixing
- Created Desktop MCP spec for Claude Desktop → VPS

---

## PINNED (Return To)

1. **ARIA Persistence** - Web/mobile isolated, ~50-60 hrs to fix. Decision needed: launch blocker or defer to post-March 1?
