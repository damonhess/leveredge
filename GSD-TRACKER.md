## How to Use

### Run a GSD
```bash
/gsd /opt/leveredge/specs/[spec-name].md
```

### After GSD Completes
```bash
mv /opt/leveredge/specs/[spec-name].md /opt/leveredge/specs/done/
```

### Update This Tracker
After moving specs, update the counts and tables above.

## Key Patterns

1. **Naming:** `gsd-*` = executable task, others = reference/design specs
2. **Mega-GSDs don't work** - Individual smaller GSDs are better
3. **V2 specs** = Agent upgrades (CHIRON, SCHOLAR, AEGIS, ATLAS)
4. **Done doesn't mean perfect** - May need revisiting post-launch
