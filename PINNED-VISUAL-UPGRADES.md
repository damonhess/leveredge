# PINNED: VISUAL DESIGN UPGRADES

*Pinned: January 17, 2026*
*Status: ON HOLD until core functionality deployed*

---

## Decision

Get everything **functional first**, then upgrade visuals. Too granular to perfect themes before the system runs.

---

## Parked Items

### Command Center Theme
- Garden Atrium concept (indoor botanical sanctuary)
- Glass dome ceiling, central fountain
- Stone portal archways to domains
- Animated elements: birds, leaves, water, particles
- Smooth portal transitions

### Midjourney Assets
- 9 domain backgrounds (one per domain + hub)
- Hybrid approach: Midjourney art + code animation overlay
- Budget: $10 Midjourney Basic subscription
- PRISM to create final prompts

### Domain Visual Themes
| Domain | Theme | Deferred Details |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| GAIA | Primordial/Volcanic | Lava rivers, obsidian |
| PANTHEON | Mount Olympus | Marble, gold, celestial |
| SENTINELS | Mythic Guardians | Stone gates, mist, glowing eyes |
| THE SHIRE | LOTR Hobbit | Green hills, round doors, cozy |
| THE KEEP | Game of Thrones | War table, ravens, stone halls |
| CHANCERY | Royal Court | Velvet, wax seals, candlelight |
| ALCHEMY | Mystic Workshop | Purple, copper, bubbling vessels |
| ARIA SANCTUM | Ethereal | Flowing gradients, stardust |

## Current Priority

1. **Build functional dashboards** - Basic UI, all agents accessible
2. **Deploy CONCLAVE V2** - Council meetings working
3. **Connect metrics** - Real data flowing
4. **Test everything** - End-to-end verification

---

## When to Revisit

After:
- [ ] All dashboards deployed and functional
- [ ] CONCLAVE V2 operational
- [ ] First successful council meeting run
- [ ] Core metrics displaying correctly

Then schedule visual upgrade sprint (estimate: 1-2 days with Midjourney + code overlay)
